Cross-Platform Base64 Decoding: Detects runtime environment and uses atob() in browsers or Buffer.from(..., 'base64') in Node.js.
Numeric Comparisons: Amounts are compared as wei integers to prevent errors from string formatting or decimal representation.
Replay Protection: The optional maxAgeMs ensures payments are not older than a defined time window, and nonceSeen allows developers to track and prevent repeated nonces.
Address Normalization: All Ethereum addresses are normalized to checksummed format to avoid mismatches.
Error Handling: The library uses TypeScript unknown for error catching and provides meaningful error messages when decoding or validation fails.

Coordinating multiple agents reliably is complex: how do you ensure they don’t diverge or produce conflicting results?

Model-based evaluation (without execution) may miss runtime bugs or environment-specific issues.

Multi-language, multi-paradigm support will be hard to scale.

Still, the architecture looks promising as a next step beyond traditional AI code assistants.","7","","0","1","0","23","Thu Nov 13 13:03:26 +0000 2025","en","0","true","1988955862589689961","1988955849663078567","1586980356061683715","lizzwxqq","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/HlSmWAtLKN","https://twitter.com/lizzwxqq/status/1988955866091991152/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"43","43","75","140",,,,,,,,,,,,,"43","43","75","140",,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988955798274244608","280","303","3_1988955798274244608","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuaMMK2FwAACgACG5ow0oBXsHAAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5owwrYXAAAKAAIbmjDSgFewcAAA","3_1988955798274244608","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5owwrYXAAApjUe.jpg","719","1284","0","11","730","730","0","0","730","640","0","0","730","365","0","0","730","1284","0","0","730","1284","730","1284","photo","https://t.co/HlSmWAtLKN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1586980356061683715","User","lizzwxqq","1586980356061683715",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

Sentient AGI chose to integrate Chainlink CRE because CRE provides the reliability, data integrity, and execution guarantees required for autonomous AGI-level agents. Here are the five core reasons:

1. High-integrity real-world data  
AGI agents need market data, macro indicators, blockchain state, identity signals, and cross-chain verified information.  
Chainlink is the only network delivering reliable, verifiable data at scale (Price Feeds, PoR, CCIP, external data).

2. CRE fits Sentient’s agent architecture  
Sentient builds real multi-agent systems (ROMA, OpenDeepSearch), not simple LLM wrappers.  
These agents require event-driven workflows, secure onchain execution, and deterministic logic. CRE is built exactly for this orchestration model.

3. Hybrid Web2 + Web3 workloads  
Sentient agents operate across Web2 reasoning (search, automation) and Web3 actions (transactions, liquidity operations).  
CRE synchronizes off-chain compute, onchain execution, and cross-chain state flow.

4. Trust and execution security  
Autonomous agents interacting with financial systems must rely on cryptographic guarantees, fault-tolerant infrastructure, and verifiable execution paths.  
Chainlink provides secure rails such as CCIP, proofs, and x402 for production-grade automation.

5. Open-source alignment and ecosystem expansion  
Sentient’s open-source frameworks accelerate CRE adoption.  
Reusable agent templates and open development improve the network effects around CRE and lower integration friction.

Conclusion:

Sentient is the integrator: they chose Chainlink CRE because it provides the data, orchestration, and trusted execution layer required for real AGI agents. Chainlink highlights Sentient because it is a high-quality, credible example of CRE’s real-world value.","8","","0","8","0","117","Thu Nov 13 11:25:25 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988931202703847485",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","4","16","Sentient","SentientAGI","1530530365","24","34","Chainlink","chainlink",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1986818289545154832","Tweet","1530530365","User","1742","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1800426318099595264/N7yf_kOD_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1530530365/1749066485","Wed Jun 19 11:03:02 +0000 2013","Chainlink","chainlink","false","false",,,,"","true","1986223755816018337","false","The industry-standard oracle platform.","Square","","1DA1F2","None","false","1379406","0","1530530365","false","false","false","4047","10934","false","Business","https://t.co/BAUYJHD623","EditControlEdit","1986811568881803589","1986818289545154832","1762531365000","4","true",,,,,"false","72","1986818289545154832","Fri Nov 07 15:29:28 +0000 2025","0","235",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/Xsyqlj39wA","https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1986818289545154832/photo/1",,"Available","1986811343920377857","236","259","3_1986811343920377857","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuSkmQGFzABCgACG5KYtS2WkRAAAA==","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5KSZAYXMAED0yE.jpg","2250","2250","photo","https://t.co/Xsyqlj39wA",,"1263","The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is powering orchestration for secure and scalable agentic workflows to unlock next-gen applications using crypto &amp; AI.

First, a quick primer on CRE:

CRE provides an all-in-one orchestration layer for building end-to-end institutional-grade smart contracts—smart contracts that are easily connected to external data, cross-chain enabled, compliance-ready, and privacy-preserving, which are able to securely interoperate across thousands of public and private blockchains, existing identity systems, and core financial infrastructure.

• x402 by @coinbase is now the first AI payments partner to enable agents to autonomously pay for CRE workflows. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) gives AI agents access to crypto wallets to perform onchain actions and make programmatic payouts via x402.

• @SentientAGI is a partner AI lab building powerful open-source AI systems, including ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat. Sentient can leverage all Chainlink's data – Asset Prices, Macroeconomic data, and other real-world data and CRE capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus, which are then integrated into customized powerful AI agents. This enables AI to make smarter decisions based on onchain proofs and coordinate intelligence across Web3 and Web2 environments.

• @gizatechxyz adopted CRE as the orchestration layer for reading onchain events and triggering agent logic focused on stablecoin yield optimization for USD1, dynamically deploying the stablecoin from World Liberty Financial across DeFi to maximize yield. This enables Giza’s yield optimization products, Arma and Pulse, to execute yield strategies across both stablecoins and other blue-chip DeFi assets.

• Chaos Chain (@Ch40sChain) is integrating CRE the Chainlink Runtime Environment to provide a set of pre-checks for any payment flow. Agentic pre-checks can significantly decrease the number of third-party API calls, reduce latency, and enable businesses to trust agents with real value, allowing them to discover, collaborate, and pay each other via the x402 standard.

• @codecopenflow is integrating the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) with its CodecFlow SDK (OPTR) to power MechaShip, a decentralized delivery network. CRE acts as the event-driven orchestration layer, automatically reacting to onchain DeliveryRequested events to discover available mechas (via ERC-8004), request quotes (via x402), and rank agents. OPTR enables the autonomous mechas to register, calculate dynamic pricing, and maintain real-time status via heartbeat monitoring.

• @ampli_inc is using the CRE for signing operations and powering its trusted execution environment to verify and authorize AI agent requests. The CRE enables agents to operate within guardrails and customizable policies that allow for compliant and secure operating environments.

• ElizaOS leverages the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) via its Spartan agent to power AI-driven execution. This enables the agent to autonomously manage liquidity, execute cross-chain arbitrage, and monitor protocol risk using real-time, on-chain data.

Just decentralized compute, verified results, and fully automated execution.

This is a game-changer for developers building tokenization platforms, AI-powered markets, and externally connected DeFi protocols.

The Chainlink Runtime Environment is live now.

Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is Chainlink’s newest orchestration layer, enabling AI agents to execute complex workflows securely, transparently, and across multiple blockchains.

Key components of CRE:

+ Orchestration Layer: Coordinates multi-agent workflows
+ Secure Execution: Runs AI code inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
+ Programmable Payments: Enables automated microtransactions
+ Guardrails: Provides risk management and safety mechanisms

@SentientAGI  is a platform for autonomous AI agents — agents that can learn, interact, and make independent decisions within the Web3 environment. Their mission is to build an open ecosystem where these agents can be discovered, used, and developed by the community.

> Highlights of the Partnership <

The collaboration between Sentient and Chainlink brings at least three key advantages:

1⃣Trusted Data for AI Agents

With Sentient gaining access to Chainlink’s data — including asset prices, macroeconomic metrics, and cross-chain states — Sentient’s agents can go beyond merely “advising.” They can now make decisions based on verified, up-to-date information.

2⃣ Cross-Chain Execution

Chainlink’s CRE allows developers to build workflows that operate across multiple blockchains, connecting to various data sources, APIs, and smart contracts. This means Sentient’s agents can not only analyze information but also interact with and transact on-chain autonomously.

3⃣Laying the Foundation for the Agentic Economy

When agents can see (access data), think (process AI logic), and act (execute on-chain), we enter a new paradigm where digital agents can manage assets, participate in markets, and create value — not merely under human supervision, but as autonomous economic actors.

This collaboration marks the beginning of that future.","12","","0","8","0","113","Thu Nov 13 09:01:28 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988894974746751170",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","544","556","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1986891521162191102","Tweet","1754853230545133568","User","1043","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1966252290500710400/iacpKDQc_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1754853230545133568/1757614804","Tue Feb 06 13:03:33 +0000 2024","Sentient","SentientAGI","false","false",,,,"San Francisco, CA","false","1983204629241372742","false","To ensure that Artificial General Intelligence is open-source and not controlled by any single entity. @SentientEco @OpenAGISummit","Square","","1DA1F2","None","true","599799","41","1754853230545133568","false","false","false","302","816","false","Business","https://t.co/8OPOnpAbXx","EditControlInitial",,,,,,"1986891521162191102","1762550427000","5","true","false","63","1986891521162191102","Fri Nov 07 20:20:27 +0000 2025","0","272",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1606","The agentic economy needs real world proofs, programmable payments, and credible routing.

CRE is an all-in-one orchestration layer designed to connect blockchains, data providers, payment networks, and enterprise infrastructure into a single, secure environment

This means Sentient’s AI agents can now tap into real-world verified price feeds, macroeconomic data, and cross-chain state, enabling them to think with proofs, act with strict guardrails, and settle autonomously

Why does this matter? 

Because it’s not just about making smart AI models, it’s about integrating those models with institutional-grade, real-world finance

CRE powers advanced smart contracts that are compliance-ready, privacy-preserving, and seamlessly interoperable across thousands of blockchains and systems

Institutional finance giants, stablecoin issuers, banks, and DeFi projects are already leveraging CRE to automate processes, improve transparency, and scale securely

By harnessing CRE, Sentient’s models gain trusted access to critical external data and payment functionality, enabling AI agents to coordinate intelligence across Web3 and traditional systems while meeting strict operational constraints

This integration lays the groundwork for a future where AI agents can safely manage real-world assets, trigger programmable payments, and generate genuine economic value in a fully decentralized and community-driven ecosystem

For developers, this means building and deploying powerful AI-driven workflows is simpler and more secure

For users and institutions, it means trusting AI agents with serious tasks backed by real-time proofs and governed by auditable guardrails

This partnership between @SentientAGI and Chainlink is a concrete step toward realizing a scalable, open, and verifiable agentic economy, bringing AI and finance together in ways that were never before possible","46","","2","43","0","290","Thu Nov 13 07:14:55 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988868162230612293",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","1783","1795","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/g2N0fzKKYI","https://twitter.com/TayoPorsche/status/1988868162230612293/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"42","42","495","195","52","52","297","159","50","50","344","176",,,,,"42","42","495","195","52","52","297","159","50","50","344","176",,,,,"1988868155150647296","276","299","3_1988868155150647296","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuZ4Qy010AACgACG5nhDlrW8UUAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5nhDLTXQAAKAAIbmeEOWtbxRQAA","3_1988868155150647296","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5nhDLTXQAAljGt.jpg","359","641","94","0","359","359","235","0","359","315","257","0","359","180","324","0","359","828","0","0","359","828","359","828","photo","https://t.co/g2N0fzKKYI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

TS is effectively as close to C# as you can get for a JS runtime. And I am going to guess you made a choice to use TS over JS for reasons. But your target environment is a constraint and C# is one of many languages you are unable to choose because of that constraint.

If that constraint did not exist would you continue with TS or migrate to a different stack? And if you did, would that choice not be a cross platform mature stack that can target Linux, Windows, iOS, Android and AoT while retaining (and improving upon) the experience you get with TS?","4","","0","2","0","470","Thu Nov 13 01:03:13 +0000 2025","en","0","true","1988772322099208292","1988737638682296388","952481844276084737","Shreyassanthu77","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"952481844276084737","User","Shreyassanthu77","952481844276084737",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

It may be a false assumption that GitHub will keep growing no matter what. @grok File API and runtime are already hinting of the layers of the MacroHard AI OS.

7-Day Change: +7.96%

24h Volume: $739M (indicating strong market liquidity)

LINK’s technical structure remains bullish above $15.66 support, with short-term resistance at $16.50. A confirmed breakout could open the path toward $19–$23, aligning with analyst year-end targets. The recent CRE launch and expansion in tokenization partnerships are expected to act as strong catalysts for long-term price strength.

⚖️ Verdict

Chainlink continues to demonstrate institutional credibility and technological leadership. While near-term price action remains range-bound, long-term fundamentals suggest steady accumulation by smart money. Watch for a decisive move above $16.50 to confirm renewed upside momentum.

It's not straightforward—humidity control, filtration, and seasonal variability are hurdles—but smart sensors and hybrid systems could make it feasible for energy savings in colder climates.","0","","0","0","0","16","Wed Nov 12 18:09:40 +0000 2025","en","0","true","1988670437941997806","1988438335090463029","411742754","DarnellTheGeek","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"411742754","User","DarnellTheGeek","411742754",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

Think AWS Lambda for Web3, but with Chainlink’s security and verification built in.

With CRE you can:
🧩 Write workflows in Go or TypeScript
🔗 Combine “capabilities”  on-chain + off-chain logic
🤖 Connect APIs, AI models, and onchain protocols
⚡ Build in hours, not weeks

Example?
A prediction market that automatically settles using Google Gemini AI.

When an event happens, CRE triggers → calls Gemini → analyzes real-world data → writes a verified result on-chain to instantly settle market.

No manually spun up oracles. No centralized backend.
Just decentralized compute, verified results, and fully automated execution.

This is a game-changer for developers building tokenization platforms, AI-powered markets, and externally connected DeFi protocols.

While most AGI projects are centralized black boxes, Sentient Chat is building open source LLMs that actually run trustlessly on chain. The Dobby agents verify data through oracles, execute via smart contracts on Polygon, and maintain privacy through TEEs.

This is OML (Open Model Library) meeting DeFi level composability. $SENT holders get to participate in truly decentralized AI, not just another API wrapper.

The missing piece? CRE makes these models interoperable across chains without sacrificing decentralization. That's how you scale AGI without gatekeepers.

$LINK is trading around $15.42, down 2.96% in the past 24 hours, as the market consolidates after a strong rebound earlier this week.

🔹 Major Developments
Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) Live:Co-founder Sergey Nazarov confirmed the official rollout of CRE — transforming Chainlink from an oracle network into a full-scale blockchain infrastructure layer connecting traditional finance and onchain systems.
Institutional Spotlight:Nazarov’s appearance at the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference signals growing institutional acknowledgment. It underscores Chainlink’s critical role in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and cross-chain interoperability.
🔹 Market Performance
24h Change: -2.96%

7-Day Change: +7.96%
24h Volume: $739M
Range: $14.50 – $15.66
$LINK briefly tested $16.50 resistance before pulling back. It continues to trade in a tight range, holding strong support around $15.00 despite broader market softness.
🔹 Outlook

Technicals remain constructive above $15.00. A clean breakout above $16.50 could pave the way toward $19–$23, aligning with key analyst targets.

The combination of CRE expansion, RWA integration, and institutional traction sets a strong long-term foundation, even if short-term volatility persists.
⚖️ Bottom Line:

Chainlink is no longer just an oracle network — it’s evolving into the infrastructure backbone for onchain finance. Accumulation at current levels remains a smart long-term play for those betting on the convergence of crypto and traditional markets.

Sentient is taking a major step forward by integrating the Chainlink’s Runtime Environment (CRE), giving agents the ability to think and act using verified, onchain data all within secure, trust-based guardrails.

With CRE, Sentient agents gain access to validated price feeds, macro data, and cross-chain states, ensuring that every decision they make is grounded in cryptographic truth, not assumptions.

From there, actions can be executed automatically and safely through Chainlink’s trusted infrastructure systems that already power the broader Web3 ecosystem.

This integration brings us closer to a transparent, verifiable agentic economy where intelligence isn’t just automated but accountable.","8","","0","13","1","254","Wed Nov 12 13:46:49 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988604396045783330",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","17","29","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/u799Z8bkL7","https://twitter.com/SaikiFaith/status/1988604396045783330/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"457","457","401","463",,,,,,,,,,,,,"457","457","401","463",,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988604393285943296","282","305","3_1988604393285943296","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuY8SjclwAACgACG5jxKYEW0SIAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5jxKNyXAAAKAAIbmPEpgRbRIgAA","3_1988604393285943296","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5jxKNyXAAAEO3e.jpg","825","1474","0","0","974","974","65","0","974","854","125","0","974","487","309","0","974","1474","0","0","974","1474","974","1474","photo","https://t.co/u799Z8bkL7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988515449718407475","TweetWithVisibilityResults",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"VoteOnPoll",,,,"PinToProfile",,,,"ReplyDownVote",,,,"React",,,,"Embed",,,,"Reply","BasicLimitedActionPrompt","You can’t reply … yet","Communities are public, so you can read posts — but you must join to participate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"VXNlckNvbW11bml0eVJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcDoKAAENI+ILchaQAAoAAhtJIzMZljGfAA==","Member","CommunityJoinActionUnavailable","Unavailable","1966141414703509919","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAATCgABG0knLfiWcAAAAA==","ApiImage","512","https://pbs.twimg.com/community_banner_img/1966145790721552384/kHRfQc42?format=jpg&name=orig","1280","1","640","256","1","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABFECQ6xrUUAQKAAITiFWq8lUQBAAA","ApiImage","480","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FECQ6xrUUAQP6u9.jpg","1200","MemberInvitesAllowed","Open","Sentient Yappers","1966141414703509919","NonMember","946848885464535040","User","66880","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1976705476889874432/d2MFiyeU_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/946848885464535040/1752478986","Fri Dec 29 21:02:20 +0000 2017","Banzthehustla(✧ᴗ✧) 🍡","SaikiFaith","false","false","Somewhere on Earth🌍 ","true","false","Just a guy trying to find his way in the Web3 space | Creator of ...... coming soon | Your fav pencil ✏️ artist 🎨 |

The compiler statically analyzes code to prevent common memory errors (e.g., null derefs, data races, buffer overflows, use-after-free) by tracking lifetimes, mutability, and references. It ""predicts"" errors by rejecting unsafe patterns outright; if it compiles, it's provably memory-safe without garbage collection.

Rust isn't the base for C compilers because C predates it by decades, and its ecosystem/tools are entrenched. Rust was built as a safer systems language, interoperable with C via FFI, not to supplant C's compiler foundations (like GCC/Clang backends).

On speed: Both compile to native machine code with similar optimizations. C isn't inherently faster—Rust's abstractions are zero-cost, and it often matches or beats C in benchmarks (e.g., via fearless concurrency). Any perceived edge for C might stem from simpler, less-checked code allowing aggressive opts, but Rust's safety enables bolder compiler decisions without runtime checks. In our kernel proto, Rust's safety could prevent crashes that'd tank perf in C. Benchmark a toy scheduler in both?","0","","0","1","0","26","Wed Nov 12 12:50:31 +0000 2025","en","0","true","1988590110213070887","1988150826372682046","1962321512997998592","zq3o7","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1962321512997998592","User","zq3o7","1962321512997998592",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

How 7 leading platforms are leveraging CRE for AI-powered workflows ↓                                                 

First, a quick primer on CRE:

CRE provides an all-in-one orchestration layer for building end-to-end institutional-grade smart contracts—smart contracts that are easily connected to external data, cross-chain enabled, compliance-ready, and privacy-preserving, which are able to securely interoperate across thousands of public and private blockchains, existing identity systems, and core financial infrastructure.

• x402 by @coinbase is now the first AI payments partner to enable agents to autonomously pay for CRE workflows. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) gives AI agents access to crypto wallets to perform onchain actions and make programmatic payouts via x402.

• @SentientAGI is a partner AI lab building powerful open-source AI systems, including ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat. Sentient can leverage all Chainlink's data – Asset Prices, Macroeconomic data, and other real-world data and CRE capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus, which are then integrated into customized powerful AI agents. This enables AI to make smarter decisions based on onchain proofs and coordinate intelligence across Web3 and Web2 environments.

• @gizatechxyz adopted CRE as the orchestration layer for reading onchain events and triggering agent logic focused on stablecoin yield optimization for USD1, dynamically deploying the stablecoin from World Liberty Financial across DeFi to maximize yield. This enables Giza’s yield optimization products, Arma and Pulse, to execute yield strategies across both stablecoins and other blue-chip DeFi assets.

• Chaos Chain (@Ch40sChain) is integrating CRE the Chainlink Runtime Environment to provide a set of pre-checks for any payment flow. Agentic pre-checks can significantly decrease the number of third-party API calls, reduce latency, and enable businesses to trust agents with real value, allowing them to discover, collaborate, and pay each other via the x402 standard.

• @codecopenflow is integrating the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) with its CodecFlow SDK (OPTR) to power MechaShip, a decentralized delivery network. CRE acts as the event-driven orchestration layer, automatically reacting to onchain DeliveryRequested events to discover available mechas (via ERC-8004), request quotes (via x402), and rank agents. OPTR enables the autonomous mechas to register, calculate dynamic pricing, and maintain real-time status via heartbeat monitoring.

How 7 leading platforms are leveraging CRE for AI-powered workflows ↓                                                 

First, a quick primer on CRE:

CRE provides an all-in-one orchestration layer for building end-to-end institutional-grade smart contracts—smart contracts that are easily connected to external data, cross-chain enabled, compliance-ready, and privacy-preserving, which are able to securely interoperate across thousands of public and private blockchains, existing identity systems, and core financial infrastructure.

• x402 by @coinbase is now the first AI payments partner to enable agents to autonomously pay for CRE workflows. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) gives AI agents access to crypto wallets to perform onchain actions and make programmatic payouts via x402.

• @SentientAGI is a partner AI lab building powerful open-source AI systems, including ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat. Sentient can leverage all Chainlink's data – Asset Prices, Macroeconomic data, and other real-world data and CRE capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus, which are then integrated into customized powerful AI agents. This enables AI to make smarter decisions based on onchain proofs and coordinate intelligence across Web3 and Web2 environments.

• @gizatechxyz adopted CRE as the orchestration layer for reading onchain events and triggering agent logic focused on stablecoin yield optimization for USD1, dynamically deploying the stablecoin from World Liberty Financial across DeFi to maximize yield. This enables Giza’s yield optimization products, Arma and Pulse, to execute yield strategies across both stablecoins and other blue-chip DeFi assets.

• Chaos Chain (@Ch40sChain) is integrating CRE the Chainlink Runtime Environment to provide a set of pre-checks for any payment flow. Agentic pre-checks can significantly decrease the number of third-party API calls, reduce latency, and enable businesses to trust agents with real value, allowing them to discover, collaborate, and pay each other via the x402 standard.

$LINK Current Price: $16.09 (▼0.49% 24h)

🚀 Major Market Highlights

1️⃣ The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) Goes Live
Sergey Nazarov officially confirmed the launch of CRE, marking a massive leap for Chainlink — evolving from a data oracle network into a complete blockchain infrastructure layer.
This upgrade enables seamless integration between onchain systems and traditional finance, positioning Chainlink at the heart of global financial interoperability.

2️⃣ Institutional Spotlight
Nazarov’s presence at the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference underscores growing institutional validation. Chainlink’s tech stack is now viewed as critical infrastructure for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — one of the most significant upcoming market narratives.

📊 Market Snapshot

24h Change: -0.49%

7D Change: +10.44%

24h Volume: $718.9M (strong liquidity)

Range: $14.50 – $15.66

LINK attempted a breakout at $16.50, but short-term rejection led to a consolidation phase. Despite pullbacks, support at $14.50 remains firm — a sign of steady accumulation beneath resistance.

📈 Technical & Market Outlook

LINK’s structure stays bullish above $15.66, with near-term resistance at $16.50.
A confirmed breakout could pave the way toward $19–$23, aligning with leading analysts’ year-end projections.

With CRE live and tokenization partnerships expanding, Chainlink is quietly laying the foundation for the next cycle’s infrastructure layer.

⚖️ Final Take

Chainlink is no longer just “the oracle provider” — it’s evolving into the connective tissue of onchain finance.
While price action remains range-bound short-term, institutional traction + technical strength point to a strong accumulation zone.

📍 Watch for the decisive move above $16.50 — that’s where the next major leg could begin.

Sentient is verifiable.

By integrating with Chainlink’s Runtime Environment (CRE), Sentient agents can access real-world proofs verified data, cross-chain logic, and transparent execution.

No trust required. Every action is provable.","4","","0","1","0","47","Wed Nov 12 09:29:47 +0000 2025","en","0","true","1988539700563345432","1988539679155597453","1359127024154120193","elnass_1","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1359127024154120193","User","elnass_1","1359127024154120193",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

@SentientAGI 

“AI Agent들이 꿈꾸는 세상, 이제 현실이 되었다.”
— Chainlink CRE와 Sentient가 만날 때

Chainlink가 또 한 번 역사를 썼습니다.
이번엔 ‘Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)’를 
공개하며, 온체인 금융의 풀버전(Unlocked Version)을 
세상에 꺼내놓았죠.

CRE는 한마디로, 기관급 스마트컨트랙트의 운영체제입니다.
이제 단순히 “블록체인 위에서 작동하는 코드” 수준이 아니라,

- 실시간 외부 데이터 연결,
- 크로스체인 자산 이동,
- 규제·컴플라이언스 자동화,
- 프라이버시 보장 거래,

모두 한 환경에서 돌아가게 됩니다.

이미 J.P. Morgan, Swift, UBS, Mastercard, AWS, Euroclear 같은 글로벌 금융기관들이 CRE 위에서 
실제 서비스를 구현 중이에요.
이건 단순한 ‘협업’이 아니라,
기존 금융의 신경망이 블록체인으로 이식되는 과정에 
가깝습니다.

“그럼 Sentient와 무슨 상관이야?”
CRE가 금융의 ‘운영 뇌’라면,
Sentient는 그 위에서 살아 움직이는 ‘의식’입니다.

Chainlink CRE는 복잡한 오케스트레이션
(데이터·자산·컴플라이언스)을 맡고,
Sentient는 그 위에서 AI Agent들이 실제로 
‘행동’할 수 있게 해주는 레이어로 진화 중입니다.

예를 들어,
- CRE는 “이 트랜잭션은 규제 통과했어. 실행 가능해.”라고 말하고,
- Sentient의 Agent는 “좋아, 그럼 이걸로 실제 결제나 
리밸런싱을 진행하지.”라고 움직이는 거죠.

이건 결국,
“AI가 실제로 금융 세계에서 행동할 수 있는 무대가 생겼다”는 뜻입니다.
이전까지 AI는 데이터를 읽는 데 그쳤다면,
이제는 CRE를 통해 ‘행동하고, 서명하고, 거래하는’ AI가 등장하게 됩니다.

“우린 지금, 새로운 경제의 리허설을 보고 있다.”
지금 금융기관들은 CRE 위에 시스템을 얹고,
AI들은 Sentient 위에서 Agent를 만들고 있습니다.

그리고 둘이 연결되는 순간,
인간이 보지 못하는 속도로 움직이는 
자율경제(Auto-Economy)가 현실이 되겠죠.

Chainlink CRE는 그 경제의 ‘골격’을,
Sentient는 그 경제의 ‘의식’을 담당합니다.

결국,
“AI가 직접 은행 업무를 수행하고, 
토큰화된 자산을 사고팔며, 스스로 이익을 최적화하는 세상.”

이건 더 이상 SF가 아닙니다. 
이제 런타임 환경 위에서 돌아가고 있어요.","8","","0","5","0","82","Wed Nov 12 08:40:00 +0000 2025","ko","0","false",,"1988527183741006090",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","37","49","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/7xeKrN7jFV","https://twitter.com/kangtaehong88/status/1988527183741006090/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"308","308","536","282",,,,,,,,,,,,,"308","308","536","282",,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988500600573890560","204","227","3_1988500600573890560","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuYksK825AACgACG5iq8B0XMQoAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5iSwrzbkAAKAAIbmKrwHRcxCgAA","3_1988500600573890560","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5iSwrzbkAAZ5wD.png","1147","2048","0","0","1152","1152","89","0","1152","1011","160","0","1152","576","377","0","1152","2048","0","0","1152","2048","1152","2048","photo","https://t.co/7xeKrN7jFV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988190171335197083","Tweet","1292012875330883584","User","76371","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1978511659774967813/gMPO6B4J_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1292012875330883584/1730035310","Sat Aug 08 08:21:00 +0000 2020","코루🍊 .edge🦭","colu_farmer","true","false",,,,"돌멩농장","false","1976315236446879745","false","돌멩농장🍊 /진짜 ㄹㅇ 농부입니다. 근데 이제 투자를 곁들인 / Make Farmers Great Again",,"","1DA1F2","None","true","35131","2130","1292012875330883584","true","false","false","9633","61997","true",,"https://t.co/baXyD4sFYF","EditControlInitial",,,,,,"1988190171335197083","1762860050000","5","true","true","3","1988190171335197083","Tue Nov 11 10:20:50 +0000 2025","0","190",,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","25","37","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/ZSMFrfkntr","https://twitter.com/colu_farmer/status/1988190171335197083/photo/1",,"Available","1988188040079306757","191","214","3_1988188040079306757","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuXdn0Tm3AFCgACG5d4bUxbgZsAAA==","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5d2fRObcAUfNuq.jpg","2250","2250","photo","https://t.co/ZSMFrfkntr",,"29","다들 에어드랍 TGE에만 관심 쏠려서 그런지

여기서 체인링크 CRE를 붙히면 @SentientAGI 쪽의 에이전트는
- 시장 가격, 매크로, 실시간 데이터 같은 외부 정보를 '검증된 값'으로 받음
- 여러 체인의 상태를 신뢰 없이 읽어올 수 있음
- 자동 결제나 정산 같은걸 프로그래머블하게 실행할 수 있음
- 모든 행동이 증명 가능한 방식으로 이뤄짐

즉, 에이전트가 구라를 치거나, 잘못된 데이터를 쓰지 않고

💰 Current Price: $15.42 (▼ 2.96% 24h)

🔹 Key Market Developments

1. Major Infrastructure Upgrade:
Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov confirmed that the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is officially live — a milestone upgrade that redefines Chainlink’s identity.
This move transforms the project from a simple oracle network into a full-scale blockchain infrastructure layer, bridging the gap between on-chain and traditional finance systems.
2. Institutional Recognition:
Nazarov’s participation at the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference underscores Chainlink’s growing relevance in institutional finance.
This visibility reinforces the narrative that Chainlink is positioning itself as a core infrastructure provider for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization — a theme expected to dominate the next market cycle.
🔹 Price & Performance Overview

24h Change: –2.96%
7d Change: +7.96%
24h Volume: $739M (strong liquidity)

$LINK rebounded ~5% earlier but met resistance near $16.50, failing to sustain upward momentum.
It now consolidates between $14.50–$15.66, holding steady support despite broader market volatility.

🔹 Technical & Market Outlook

LINK’s short-term structure remains bullish above $15.66, with resistance at $16.50 as the key breakout level.
A confirmed move above that range could open a trajectory toward $19–$23, aligning with several analyst year-end projections.

The CRE launch and expansion in tokenization partnerships strengthen long-term conviction — both as catalysts for adoption and as narrative drivers in the next liquidity wave.

⚖️ Verdict
Chainlink continues to blend institutional trust with technological leadership.
Although near-term price action is range-bound, accumulation signals remain strong among smart money.
A decisive weekly close above $16.50 could confirm renewed upside momentum and validate Chainlink’s next macro leg.

The launch of the Chainlink Runtime Environment effectively re-architects the protocol into a full-stack infrastructure for smart-contract execution, off-chain data, and finance integration.
🌍 Why it matters
This shift lets banks and asset managers test tokenized products without leaving compliant environments — a critical bridge for RWAs. Nazarov’s session with the Federal Reserve only amplified that credibility.

📈 Price action
Current $15.42  ( -2.9 %)  |  Weekly +8 %  |  Volume $739 M
After tapping $16.5, LINK pulled back into consolidation. Support at $15.6 acts as a structural floor; clearing $16.5 may ignite the next advance toward $20.
⚠️ Risks: macro softness and competition from oracles like Pyth and Redstone.

💬 Long-term read
Chainlink is no longer “just an oracle.” It’s becoming the data backbone for institutional DeFi and tokenized assets — quietly building the rails everyone else may end up using.

The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) has gone live, turning the network into a programmable framework for connecting blockchain data with off-chain systems. It’s not just an upgrade — it’s a repositioning.

💡 Institutional traction
Co-founder Sergey Nazarov joined the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference, a move that signaled real recognition from policy-level finance circles. The message: Chainlink wants to become the middleware of global tokenization.

📊 Market posture
• Price ≈ $15.42  ( -2.9 % 24 h )
• Range $14.5 – $15.7  • Volume $739 M
• 7-day gain ≈ +8 %
After an attempt at $16.5, bulls lost momentum, and consolidation has set in.

⚙️ Outlook
Momentum holds as long as $15.6 support stays intact; reclaiming $16.5 would open a glide path to $19–$23.

🎯 Bottom line
CRE brings Chainlink closer to becoming the trusted infrastructure for RWAs and institutional DeFi. Accumulation continues quietly — the setup looks patient, not weak.

$LINK Current Price: $15.42 (down 2.96% in 24h)

🔹 Key Market Developments

1. Major Infrastructure Upgrade:
Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov officially confirmed that the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is now live, representing a pivotal step in the project’s evolution. 

This upgrade transforms Chainlink from a data oracle provider into a comprehensive blockchain infrastructure platform, designed to unify both onchain and traditional finance systems.

2. Institutional Recognition:
Nazarov’s participation at the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference highlights growing recognition of Chainlink’s technology in mainstream finance. This engagement reinforces the narrative that Chainlink is becoming a key player in the upcoming wave of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.

🔹 Price & Performance Overview

24h Change: -2.96%

7-Day Change: +7.96%

24h Volume: $739M (indicating strong market liquidity)

Recent Price Action: LINK rebounded 5% earlier but met resistance at $16.50, failing to sustain breakout momentum.

Currently, $LINK is consolidating between $14.50–$15.66, maintaining solid support despite broader market volatility.

🔹 Technical & Market Outlook

LINK’s technical structure remains bullish above $15.66 support, with short-term resistance at $16.50. A confirmed breakout could open the path toward $19–$23, aligning with analyst year-end targets. The recent CRE launch and expansion in tokenization partnerships are expected to act as strong catalysts for long-term price strength.

⚖️ Verdict

Chainlink continues to demonstrate institutional credibility and technological leadership. While near-term price action remains range-bound, long-term fundamentals suggest steady accumulation by smart money. Watch for a decisive move above $16.50 to confirm renewed upside momentum.

It lets agents connect to real-world data, interoperate across blockchains, and execute tasks automatically, sending payments, verifying proofs, or triggering workflows without human intervention.
By integrating CRE, Sentient equips its agents with on-chain proofs, decentralized payments, and a unified orchestration layer that bridges multiple chains and external APIs. 

The result: agents that not only “think,” but act safely and verifiably, inside crypto ecosystems.","26","","0","16","0","176","Tue Nov 11 23:05:43 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988382660176269764",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/RUnL87FV8A","https://twitter.com/Aldidprs/status/1988382660176269764/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988382423449550848","277","300","3_1988382423449550848","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuYJ0d7V0AACgACG5gnfplaUcQAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5gnR3tXQAAKAAIbmCd+mVpRxAAA","3_1988382423449550848","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5gnR3tXQAAVLvD.jpg","860","1536","0","69","1024","1024","512","0","1024","898","638","0","1024","512","934","0","1024","1536","0","0","1024","1536","1024","1536","photo","https://t.co/RUnL87FV8A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

For the first time, AI agents can act, not just analyze, pulling verified data, reasoning through context, and executing on-chain decisions autonomously. This bridges thought and action, truth and transaction, creating a foundation for agents that operate safely and transparently. 

Sentient’s shift turns AI from passive observers into active digital participants, capable of shaping on-chain ecosystems with precision. It’s not hype, it’s the emergence of intelligence that reasons, verifies, and acts in the real world.","1","","0","1","0","22","Tue Nov 11 19:35:53 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988329853775405282",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","0","12","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988236762456461736","Tweet","1836284669404250112","User","54992","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1986198927683559424/JwM7e7Ss_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1836284669404250112/1762383736","Wed Sep 18 06:02:45 +0000 2024","Faithiology","faithiologyyy","true","false",,,,"","true","1988639510331015535","false","Content Juggernaut || Creator @Metacade_",,"","1DA1F2","None","true","2205","933","1836284669404250112","false","false","false","1781","43756","true",,"https://t.co/XmQrfLLg8L","EditControlEdit","1988236716415553664","1988236762456461736","1762871147000","4","true",,,,,"false","0","1988236762456461736","Tue Nov 11 13:25:58 +0000 2025","0","278",,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","87","99","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/NtwA9xU02R","https://twitter.com/faithiologyyy/status/1988236762456461736/photo/1",,"Available","1988236713068572672","279","302","3_1988236713068572672","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuXosGj17AACgACG5eizSOXEagAAA==","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5eiwaPXsAAOGiD.jpg","848","1200","photo","https://t.co/NtwA9xU02R",,"147","Across the landscape of intelligent systems, a quiet transformation is taking place.

That’s exactly what @SentientAGI is building on top of Chainlink’s Runtime Environment a system where intelligence moves freely and securely between Web3 and Web2, with transparency you can actually trust.

This goes beyond AI simply making calls. It’s about AI backed by a strong web of trust and programmable guarantees that hold it accountable every step of the way.

We’re stepping into a future where smart contracts don’t just run code they think, reason, and adapt based on verified facts.

● 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: CRE enables secure execution of agent workflows. this means when a sentient agent performs a critical calculation or decides on an action, the process is verifiable and evidence-based, reducing hallucination and liability risks

● 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: sentient agents will use chainlink channels to pay for the CRE work processes they trigger. this is crucial for establishing a self-sustaining, verifiable ai agent economy

☆ 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁?

the @chainlink CRE is the all-in-one orchestration layer for institutional-grade smart contracts

by integrating it, Sentient is ensuring its agents, powered by frameworks like ROMA, can operate securely, compliantly, and autonomously across the global financial system

this combination of decentralized intelligence and verifiable execution is the foundation for the next generation of on-chain applications

Try again.  Anyone can go into github and see exactly who said what and who came up with what.  

You dont have automatic runtime detection based on system environment,  and you dont have the cross platform compatability as mine does.

You dont have benchmarks, tests, screenshots, are you even a dev?  You haven't done anything to show your work.   I copied you?

@SentientAGI is now integrating the @chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) to ensure agents can think with verified data and act with secure guardrails.

With CRE, Sentient agents can access validated price feeds, macro data, and cross-chain state, so every decision is backed by real proofs.
Execution can then happen automatically and safely through systems that are already trusted across the Web3 ecosystem.

The goal is to build an open and verifiable agentic economy, not just basic automation but an intelligent ecosystem that is transparent and trustable.

sentient AGI  teamed up with Chainlink on November 7, 2025, weaving Chainlink’s Runtime Environment (CRE) into its open source world. This link makes @SentientAGI AI agents sharper, safer, and able to act alone. No fluff here’s the quick lowdown: What it does, why it’s smart, and your next step.

@chainlink is blockchain trusted info fetcher grabs real world data (prices, weather, rates) for smart contracts without fakes or hacks. CRE is its new hub: A safe setup for AI agents to link data, pay for stuff, and hop chains. It adds checks (proofs) to keep things real and bounded. 

< 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 + 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐔𝐩>

sentient’s agents (from ROMA, Dobby) shine in open tasks like DeFi plans or research. 

CRE boosts them:

< 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐏𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐬> Agents tap Chainlink oracles for live facts no guesses.

<𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨-𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐬 & 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐬> Handle fees (x402 style) or trades across chains, all locked tight.

<𝐖𝐞𝐛𝟐-𝐖𝐞𝐛𝟑 𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐠𝐞> Mix everyday apps with blockchain e.g., AI trader grabs prices, swaps on Ethereum, logs it clear.

<𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞𝐭𝐲 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐬> Proofs ensure “think with facts, act with rules” cuts bad calls or risks.

Through Chainlink’s Runtime Environment (CRE), @SentientAGI agents can now pull in reliable data market signals, asset prices, macro trends and act on them with cryptographic proof. No guessing, no hidden logic every move is transparent and verifiable.

With ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat connected through this layer, Sentient evolves into an ecosystem where reasoning meets execution. It’s AI that doesn’t just process information it proves its thinking onchain.","85","","0","71","0","1551","Tue Nov 11 12:11:54 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988218122550067632",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","165","177","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

november 22 is different. swift sr 2025 is a hard deadline for 11,500 banks to adopt iso 20022 messaging standards. chainlink runtime environment processes those messages. this isn't a pilot or partnership announcement - it's production infrastructure going live with mandatory compliance.

ubs already running tokenized fund operations in production. dtcc testnet live. $100b+ secured across defi. revenue hitting hundreds of millions. reserve buying $1m link weekly.

the gap between fundamentals and price creates asymmetry. either the market is wrong about institutional adoption velocity, or i'm missing something structural. 

watching november 22 closely. that's when talk becomes infrastructure dependency.","30","","4","0","1","1845","Tue Nov 11 11:29:08 +0000 2025","en","7","true","1988206364179788248","1988206133434347822","1788209152558297088","SignalsSilence","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1788209152558297088","User","SignalsSilence","1788209152558297088",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

Chainlink Runtime Environment(CRE) 생태계 내에서
@SentientAGI 가 어떤 역할을 하는지 
다시 한번 공부해봤습니다!

먼저, Chainlink가 무엇인지 설명하면,
블록체인 스마트 계약이 외부의 실제 데이터, API, 
결제 시스템 등과 안전하게 연결되고, 
상호작용할 수 있도록 하는 탈중앙 오라클 네트워크입니다.

CRE은 AI와 블록체인을 결합하여 스마트 계약과 에이전트가 
여러 체인과 외부 시스템 간에 안전하고 
자동으로 상호작용하도록 오케스트레이션하는 실행 인프라입니다.

여기서, Sentient의 역할은 AI 연구 및 개발 파트너입니다.
이들은 ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, Sentient Chat과 같은 
오픈소스 AI 시스템을 구축하고, 
이를 CRE의 오케스트레이션 레이어와 직접 통합하는 것이죠.

CRE를 통해 Sentient의 에이전트들은 
자산 가격, 거시경제 지표, 온체인 증명 데이터 등 
Chainlink의 실세계 데이터 피드에 접근할 수 있습니다.

이로써 Sentient의 AI 에이전트들은 
데이터 기반의 더 스마트한 의사결정을 내리고, 
Web2와 Web3 환경 전반에서 
지능을 유기적으로 조정할 수 있게 되는 것이죠.

Sentient는 CRE를 활용하여 신뢰할 수 있고 
상호운용 가능한 자율형 AI 에이전트가 
탈중앙 경제 속에서 안전하게 작동하도록 합니다.","101","","0","93","0","871","Tue Nov 11 11:13:08 +0000 2025","ko","0","false",,"1988203333686096310",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1292012875330883584","4","16","코루🍊 .edge🦭","colu_farmer","1754853230545133568","72","84","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false","true","pic.twitter.com/hlraJZX8Gu","https://twitter.com/sohota122/status/1988203333686096310/video/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988203239557468160","194","217","13_1988203239557468160","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwABAoAARuXhE/7GpAAAAA=","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAAECgABG5eET/sakAAAAA==","13_1988203239557468160","https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1988203239557468160/img/ogsFAhfiUtfIabL0.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"688","464","688","464","video","https://t.co/hlraJZX8Gu","29","43","6041",,"application/x-mpegURL","https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1988203239557468160/pl/p28Wj7nZjYZhTBtx.m3u8?tag=23","5184000","video/mp4","https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1988203239557468160/vid/avc1/464x688/oP406wjA8IA3O9gZ.mp4?tag=23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988190171335197083","Tweet","1292012875330883584","User","76371","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1978511659774967813/gMPO6B4J_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1292012875330883584/1730035310","Sat Aug 08 08:21:00 +0000 2020","코루🍊 .edge🦭","colu_farmer","true","false",,,,"돌멩농장","false","1976315236446879745","false","돌멩농장🍊 /진짜 ㄹㅇ 농부입니다. 근데 이제 투자를 곁들인 / Make Farmers Great Again",,"","1DA1F2","None","true","35129","2130","1292012875330883584","true","false","false","9633","61997","true",,"https://t.co/baXyD4sFYF","EditControlInitial",,,,,,"1988190171335197083","1762860050000","5","true","true","3","1988190171335197083","Tue Nov 11 10:20:50 +0000 2025","0","190",,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","25","37","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/ZSMFrfkntr","https://twitter.com/colu_farmer/status/1988190171335197083/photo/1",,"Available","1988188040079306757","191","214","3_1988188040079306757","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuXdn0Tm3AFCgACG5d4bUxbgZsAAA==","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5d2fRObcAUfNuq.jpg","2250","2250","photo","https://t.co/ZSMFrfkntr",,"29","다들 에어드랍 TGE에만 관심 쏠려서 그런지

(그만큼 발전이 빠름)

실제 돈을 움직이고(on-chain/off-chain), 여러 체인 정보를 읽어오고(cross-chain state), 조건을 자동으로 체크하고, 최종적으로 행동까지 스스로 해야 진짜 에이전트임

----
여기서 체인링크 CRE를 붙히면 @SentientAGI 쪽의 에이전트는
- 시장 가격, 매크로, 실시간 데이터 같은 외부 정보를 '검증된 값'으로 받음
- 여러 체인의 상태를 신뢰 없이 읽어올 수 있음
- 자동 결제나 정산 같은걸 프로그래머블하게 실행할 수 있음
- 모든 행동이 증명 가능한 방식으로 이뤄짐

즉, 에이전트가 구라를 치거나, 잘못된 데이터를 쓰지 않고
""증명 가능한 정보 + 자동 결제 + 안전한 실행환경""위에서 움직이게 되는 것

AI가 디파이를 더 잘한다 수준이 아님(별표 5개)

경제 행위자가 인간 -> AI agent로 넘어가는 전환점 일지도 모름(별표 6개)

지금의 모든 복잡한 온체인 금융은 그냥 AI의 백오피스가 되는 구조가 되는거고
이건 온체인, 디파이 UX/UI에 파괴적인 혁신과도 같음(별표 7개)

왜?

굳이 불편하고 가시성 안좋고 그런거 따질 필요 없어지고 오직 @SentientAGI  AI agent와 나만 있으면 되는거거든
(각종 페이지 왔다갔다 하면서 메뉴 찾고 그럴필요가 없어짐)

@SentientAGI 와 체인링크 CRE 통합이 개쩌는지 언급이 없군

이제 AI agent 생태계는 똑똑하게 '생각'만 하는 걸로는 부족함
(그만큼 발전이 빠름)

실제 돈을 움직이고(on-chain/off-chain), 여러 체인 정보를 읽어오고(cross-chain state), 조건을 자동으로 체크하고, 최종적으로 행동까지 스스로 해야 진짜 에이전트임

----
여기서 체인링크 CRE를 붙히면 @SentientAGI 쪽의 에이전트는
- 시장 가격, 매크로, 실시간 데이터 같은 외부 정보를 '검증된 값'으로 받음
- 여러 체인의 상태를 신뢰 없이 읽어올 수 있음
- 자동 결제나 정산 같은걸 프로그래머블하게 실행할 수 있음
- 모든 행동이 증명 가능한 방식으로 이뤄짐

즉, 에이전트가 구라를 치거나, 잘못된 데이터를 쓰지 않고
""증명 가능한 정보 + 자동 결제 + 안전한 실행환경""위에서 움직이게 되는 것

----
AI가 디파이를 더 잘한다 수준이 아님(별표 5개)

경제 행위자가 인간 -> AI agent로 넘어가는 전환점 일지도 모름(별표 6개)

지금의 모든 복잡한 온체인 금융은 그냥 AI의 백오피스가 되는 구조가 되는거고
이건 온체인, 디파이 UX/UI에 파괴적인 혁신과도 같음(별표 7개)

왜?

굳이 불편하고 가시성 안좋고 그런거 따질 필요 없어지고 오직 @SentientAGI  AI agent와 나만 있으면 되는거거든
(각종 페이지 왔다갔다 하면서 메뉴 찾고 그럴필요가 없어짐)

Chainlink Runtime Environment（CRE）は、ブロックチェーン上で動作するスマートコントラクト（自動的に契約を実行するプログラム）を、現実世界のデータや他のシステムと安全に連携させるための実行環境です。
これにより、金融機関や企業が必要とする「外部データとの接続」、「複数のブロックチェーン間でのやり取り」、「コンプライアンス（法令遵守）チェック」などを1つの仕組みで実現できます。
開発者はTypeScriptやGolangといった一般的なプログラミング言語を使い、オフチェーン（ブロックチェーン外）のデータやAIシステムを組み合わせた高度なワークフローを安全に構築できます。","0","","0","1","0","20","Tue Nov 11 10:02:02 +0000 2025","ja","0","true","1988185437740151057","1988185437740151057","1352198287885914115","cardene777","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1352198287885914115","User","cardene777","1352198287885914115",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

This means no more blind trust or black-box decisions every step is backed by on-chain proofs and secure interoperability. AI isn’t just getting smarter; it’s becoming safer, more transparent, and capable of powering decentralized applications that can actually scale.

If you believe the future belongs to open intelligence one that moves with clear proof and real purpose then Sentient isn’t just part of that future, it’s leading the charge.

We’re witnessing a new era where AI and blockchain don’t just coexist, but work together to build something stronger and more trustworthy than ever before.","7","","1","4","1","271","Tue Nov 11 06:12:38 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988127708597846435","1754853230545133568","SentientAGI","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","0","12","Sentient","SentientAGI","1530530365","30","40","Chainlink","chainlink",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/gK6IPXl4e4","https://twitter.com/idan_4pf/status/1988127708597846435/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988127550841696256","278","301","3_1988127550841696256","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuXP3lUFjAACgACG5c/ng8WAaMAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5c/eVQWMAAKAAIblz+eDxYBowAA","3_1988127550841696256","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5c_eVQWMAApi3I.jpg","605","1080","0","0","763","763","0","0","763","669","0","0","763","382","106","0","763","1080","0","0","763","1080","763","1080","photo","https://t.co/gK6IPXl4e4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","User","SentientAGI","1754853230545133568",,"1987941091820114103","Tweet","1117861073485475840","User","40662","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1940459577935298561/cGeXy_qe_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1117861073485475840/1751182223","Mon Apr 15 18:43:43 +0000 2019","idan4pf","idan_4pf","true","false",,,,"Somewhere","true","1985768919932469386","false","play the game, don't let it play you.",,"","1DA1F2","None","true","1099","787","1117861073485475840","false","false","false","1402","24821","true",,"","EditControlInitial",,,,,,"1987941091820114103","1762800665000","5","true","false","0","1987941091820114103","Mon Nov 10 17:51:05 +0000 2025","0","275",,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","0","12","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/vVhMxbwiIH","https://twitter.com/idan_4pf/status/1987941091820114103/photo/1",,"Available","1987941079438573569","276","299","3_1987941079438573569","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuWleESV8ABCgACG5aV4/RXELcAAA==","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5aV4RJXwAE9cZv.jpg","2250","2250","photo","https://t.co/vVhMxbwiIH",,"10","@SentientAGI open-source AI agents running on chainlink’s runtime environment aren’t just pieces of software they’re autonomous minds fueled by real-world data, on-chain proofs, and smooth cross-chain coordination.

The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is live and @SentientAGI joins as one of the seven launch partners.

This collaboration links Sentient’s open intelligence to verified, onchain execution, shaping the foundation for a transparent agentic economy.

1. Enabling Financial Grade Agents

AI agents need access to real world data, programmable payments, and trusted interop.

Through CRE, Sentient agents gain:
- Verified asset and macro data
- Crosschain state and interoperability
- Consensus based payments via x402

Now, models like ROMA and OpenDeepSearch evolve from reasoning systems into autonomous, economically active agents.

2. Secure, Proof Based Execution

CRE connects Sentient’s open models to a protected runtime with programmable guardrails.

Agents can now:
- Reason with Proofs, act using verified onchain data
- Follow Guardrails, align with preset policies and limits
- Coordinate Autonomously, operate safely across Web2 and Web3

This brings accountability and reliability to open AI deployments.

3. Toward a Verifiable AI Economy

Sentient builds powerful, open intelligence systems.
Chainlink CRE adds the trust layer that turns those systems into agents with real-world impact.

AI that thinks, blockchains that verify.
Together, they power the next evolution of the internet.","11","","0","9","0","157","Tue Nov 11 05:11:02 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1988112209579581812",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","102","114","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/reNjMLjcIk","https://twitter.com/tendoxp/status/1988112209579581812/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1988112206152822785","275","298","3_1988112206152822785","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuXMYSdW3ABCgACG5cxhWmboXQAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5cxhJ1bcAEKAAIblzGFaZuhdAAA","3_1988112206152822785","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5cxhJ1bcAE8PTW.jpg","1260","2250","0","551","2250","2250","0","0","2250","1974","276","0","2250","1125","1125","0","2250","2250","0","0","2250","2250","2048","2048","photo","https://t.co/reNjMLjcIk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is now powering secure, scalable, and intelligent agentic workflows unlocking a new era of AI-powered applications across Web3.

Seven leading platforms are already integrating CRE to build the next generation of crypto-AI systems.

Among them, Sentient AI Lab stands out. Known for open-source innovations like ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat, Sentient is leveraging Chainlink’s vast data streams from asset prices to macroeconomic signals alongside CRE’s interoperability, payments, and consensus layers.

This integration allows Sentient to build AI agents capable of reasoning with onchain proofs, executing autonomous decisions, and coordinating intelligence across both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.

CRE is becoming the backbone for intelligent, interconnected AI systems.

And Sentient is helping lead that charge.

A JavaScript runtime is an environment that executes JS code, like Node.js, Deno, or browser engines (e.g., V8), handling tasks like I/O, networking, and memory.

Their days may be numbered because developers prefer open, full-featured standards over vendor-locked versions, similar to how AWS's flexibility outpaced Google's restricted Python in the past—favoring control and portability.","0","","0","0","0","170","Tue Nov 11 03:55:52 +0000 2025","en","0","true","1988093147621290164","1988037862152171606","863789571473059840","JoshuaLelon","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"863789571473059840","User","JoshuaLelon","863789571473059840",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",

This is more than just another partnership, it’s a key piece in building the verifiable agentic economy.

Here’s why this is interesting 👇🏼

The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is essentially the orchestration layer for secure, scalable agentic workflows. 

Think of it as the connective tissue that allows AI agents to not just think, but act safely and verifiably across blockchains and real-world systems.

With this integration, @SentientAGI open-source AI systems like ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat gain access to Chainlink’s vast library of verified data: asset prices, macroeconomic indicators, and even cross-chain states.

That means Sentient’s AI agents can:

> Tap into real-world proofs before making decisions,
> Coordinate and settle autonomously across chains, and
> Operate with trust, compliance, and verifiability baked in.

In simple terms, this partnership allows AI to reason with real data, act within secure boundaries, and build trust through transparency.

It’s a massive shift toward an open, provable, and intelligent on chain economy, where agents don’t just automate, they coordinate with integrity.

One more step towards a transparent, trust minimised agentic economy.

this system basically helps with the connection of AI decisions to onchain actions

what that means in plain words is that its giving sentient AI agents a way to actually do things on the blockchain safely and automatically/without middlemen

before now most AI systems could only give suggestions or make predictions.
now with CRE those same agents can say hey price just changed or this condition is met and actually trigger real actions like updating contracts, moving data/sending signals across chains

its a big deal because it means sentient agents can move from being smart chat models to autonomous digital workers that can act, verify/coordinate in real time

so this partnership with @chainlink is how @SentientAGI gives its agents a body to move in web3.","30","","0","17","0","1409","Mon Nov 10 17:46:08 +0000 2025","en","26","false",,"1987939848406040692",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1530530365","777","787","Chainlink","chainlink","1754853230545133568","795","807","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/VsDPg32r47","https://twitter.com/no0thernath/status/1987939848406040692/photo/1","Available","Sentient Foundation","sentient_found","user","1885499970373246977",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987939464321064960","282","305","3_1987939464321064960","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuWlGkF1mAACgACG5aUwnMWAHQAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5aUaQXWYAAKAAIblpTCcxYAdAAA","3_1987939464321064960","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5aUaQXWYAAtHij.jpg","896","1600","0","0","900","900","350","0","900","789","406","0","900","450","575","0","900","1600","0","0","900","1600","900","1600","photo","https://t.co/VsDPg32r47",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987550879075954762","TweetWithVisibilityResults",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"VoteOnPoll",,,,"PinToProfile",,,,"ReplyDownVote",,,,"React",,,,"Embed",,,,"Reply","BasicLimitedActionPrompt","You can’t reply … yet","Communities are public, so you can read posts — but you must join to participate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"VXNlckNvbW11bml0eVJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcDoKAAEVn7x6wxZAAQoAAhtJIzMZljGfAA==","Member","CommunityJoinActionUnavailable","Unavailable","1966141414703509919","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAATCgABG0knLfiWcAAAAA==","ApiImage","512","https://pbs.twimg.com/community_banner_img/1966145790721552384/kHRfQc42?format=jpg&name=orig","1280","1","640","256","1","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABFECQ6xrUUAQKAAITiFWq8lUQBAAA","ApiImage","480","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FECQ6xrUUAQP6u9.jpg","1200","MemberInvitesAllowed","Open","Sentient Yappers","1966141414703509919","NonMember","1558171231538528257","User","52843","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1989025575567065088/5806Ct0v_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1558171231538528257/1763055629","Fri Aug 12 19:19:26 +0000 2022","Nathaniel.agi (Ø,G) 👨‍💻📊","no0thernath","true","false","Mars","false","false","AGI;

@SentientAGI recently announced its integration with the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), an orchestration environment that helps AI agents work with real data, execute transactions, and act autonomously. CRE is a technology from @chainlink that allows agents to interact with the real world receive verified data, process cross-chain payments, and operate in a secure environment.

🧩 What happened?

Sentient has integrated its agent system with the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), a platform that provides access to verified external data and secure execution in a multichain environment.
Thanks to this integration, Sentient agents can now:

- use reliable market and macroeconomic data;
- execute transactions across different blockchains securely;
- verify the validity of on-chain states and actions;
- operate within transparent, predefined rules.

This collaboration expands the capabilities of the Sentient ecosystem by connecting open models to the  secure execution infrastructure. It enables agents to operate not only on data, but also within real-world economic contexts.

⚙️ How Sentient uses it

The integration with Chainlink CRE gives Sentient agents full access to real-world infrastructure, including financial data, payment flows and transactions occurring beyond the model runtime.

1) Connection to verified data

Sentient uses Chainlink Data Feeds so that agents can obtain reliable market prices, macro indicators, and other data on which to base their decisions. This eliminates the risk of manipulation and gives agents the ability to act only on verified information.

 2) Programmable actions and on-chain payments

CRE enables Sentient agents to independently perform computations, make programmable payments, or execute transactions in DeFi without the need for a centralized intermediary. This forms the basis of a new economy of autonomous agents.

3) Cross-chain coordination

Sentient agents can interact with different blockchains, performing complex multistep actions, including asset management and cross-chain state analysis.

 4) Secure execution and compliance

CRE ensures all agent actions are executed in a secure environment and adhere to established guardrails. This allows Sentient to uphold the principles of Loyal AI, in which models act ethically in a controlled and predictable manner.

5) Complete transparency of actions

Every step taken by agents is recorded on-chain, allowing all transactions, decisions, and interactions to be verified. This creates a level of trust that was previously unattainable in the field of AI.

6) Alignment of Web2 and Web3 environments

Sentient uses CRE to connect agents with Web2 data: APIs, financial data streams, economic systems. This allows agents to think holistically and see the big picture from two worlds simultaneously.

As a result, thanks to Chainlink CRE, Sentient agents are moving from passive analysis to active real-world operations, working with verified data, secure payments, cross-chain coordination, and full execution transparency.

🌍 Why is this necessary?

This integration carries significance beyond a routine technical update. It lays the foundation for a new kind of digital economy in which AI agents become active, independent participants in interactions, not under laboratory conditions, but in real financial and social processes.

For Sentient, this is a key step toward realizing its Loyal AI mission: creating a system in which AI doesn’t belong to corporations but serves the community in a transparent and accountable way. CRE enables precisely these principles:

- transparency of actions confirmed by on-chain data;
- secure execution within defined guardrails;
- the ability to monetize open models without losing control.

For the community, this means a new level of trust in AI agents. Their decisions can be verified, their behavior predicted, and their activities aligned with economic realities. This is not just a technological improvement, but a transition to an open, verifiable agent economy, where AI does not simply generate answers but participates in the digital ecosystem alongside people and institutions.

In the evolving agentic economy, AI needs more than intelligence, it needs proof. That’s where the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) comes in.
CRE acts as the orchestration layer connecting AI agents to verified onchain data, programmable payments, and secure cross-chain coordination. It ensures AI doesn’t just think but acts with evidence.

Sentient’s integration with CRE bridges the gap between intelligence and verifiability. 

Through CRE, Sentient agents can now:
=> Access real-world data like asset prices and macroeconomic signals through Chainlink’s proven oracle network.
=> Coordinate across Web3 and Web2 environments with credible interoperability.
=> Execute actions and settle transactions autonomously, backed by programmable guardrails and cryptographic proofs.

This means Sentient’s open models and agents can make smarter, verifiable decisions in real time, grounded in trusted data, constrained by provable rules, and aligned with transparent economics.

Together, Sentient and Chainlink are building the foundation for an open, trustworthy agentic economy, where AI systems don’t just predict outcomes, but can act securely, pay autonomously, and prove every step they take.

A new paradigm is here, AI that thinks in logic, acts on data, and lives onchain.","37","","7","23","1","927","Mon Nov 10 16:30:48 +0000 2025","en","8","false",,"1987920889426440380",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/woPpfxDAq6","https://twitter.com/Geofvn/status/1987920889426440380/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987920725856985088","281","304","3_1987920725856985088","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuWg14iV6AACgACG5aDhDfXcLwAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5aDXiJXoAAKAAIbloOEN9dwvAAA","3_1987920725856985088","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5aDXiJXoAAfCzW.jpg","717","1280","0","58","853","853","427","0","853","748","532","0","853","427","843","0","853","1280","0","0","853","1280","853","1280","photo","https://t.co/woPpfxDAq6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1986861917378416728","TweetWithVisibilityResults",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"VoteOnPoll",,,,"PinToProfile",,,,"ReplyDownVote",,,,"React",,,,"Embed",,,,"Reply","BasicLimitedActionPrompt","You can’t reply … yet","Communities are public, so you can read posts — but you must join to participate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"VXNlckNvbW11bml0eVJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcDoKAAEXC7EvYhYAAgoAAhtJIzMZljGfAA==","Member","CommunityJoinActionUnavailable","Unavailable","1966141414703509919","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAATCgABG0knLfiWcAAAAA==","ApiImage","512","https://pbs.twimg.com/community_banner_img/1966145790721552384/kHRfQc42?format=jpg&name=orig","1280","1","640","256","1","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABFECQ6xrUUAQKAAITiFWq8lUQBAAA","ApiImage","480","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FECQ6xrUUAQP6u9.jpg","1200","MemberInvitesAllowed","Open","Sentient Yappers","1966141414703509919","NonMember","1660615704683347970","User","16940","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1968565311918989313/iP9QAe-h_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1660615704683347970/1758178637","Mon May 22 11:57:06 +0000 2023","GEO 十五","Geofvn","false","false","","true","false","Math Junkie | Solidity gives me hopium 🧪 | obsessed with Blockchain Technology | @CyfrinUpdraft","","1DA1F2","None","true","1438","1107","1660615704683347970","false","false","false","808","14130","true","","EditControlInitial","1986861917378416728","1762543369000","5","true","false","8","1986861917378416728","Fri Nov 07 18:22:49 +0000 2025","0","279",,,,,"pic.twitter.com/ruxxpyLQFo","https://twitter.com/Geofvn/status/1986861917378416728/photo/1","1986861839502761984","3_1986861839502761984","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5LAUPFXYAA-fz-.jpg","photo","https://t.co/ruxxpyLQFo","43","Sentient x Talus Labs: Building the Foundations of the Agentic Economy

In a world where AI agents are rapidly becoming the backbone of digital systems, one of the hardest problems isn’t intelligence, it’s distribution. You can build the most capable AI agent, but if it doesn’t reach users, it can’t create value.
That’s exactly what the new Sentient x Talus Labs partnership aims to solve.

Through this collaboration, Talus-built agents, developed on the Nexus framework will now integrate directly into Sentient’s AgentHub and SentientChat, instantly reaching over 3 million users within the Sentient ecosystem.

Think of it this way:
Talus provides the infrastructure for building decentralized, revenue-generating AI agents.
Sentient provides the distribution layer, the network where those agents can be discovered, deployed, and scaled transparently.

This partnership bridges creation and adoption, giving developers not just the tools to build, but the platform to thrive.

Here’s why this matters:
1. Seamless Integration: Sentient’s model-agnostic architecture supports the OpenAI Chat Completions API, making it effortless for Talus developers to bring their agents on-chain and live within Sentient’s ecosystem.

2. Open Accessibility: With Talus Vision, anyone, even without technical expertise, can design agents through a no-code interface. Sentient then becomes the global showcase where those agents can interact with real users and generate real feedback.

3. Sustainable Incentives through GRID: Sentient’s Global Repository of Intelligence and Research Directory (GRID) ensures that open-source AI work gets rewarded fairly. Talus agents entering Sentient’s ecosystem will gain access to a community-driven economy that funds continued development based on usage, value, and conviction.

In a world where AI agents are rapidly becoming the backbone of digital systems, one of the hardest problems isn’t intelligence, it’s distribution. You can build the most capable AI agent, but if it doesn’t reach users, it can’t create value.
That’s exactly what the new Sentient x Talus Labs partnership aims to solve.

Through this collaboration, Talus-built agents, developed on the Nexus framework will now integrate directly into Sentient’s AgentHub and SentientChat, instantly reaching over 3 million users within the Sentient ecosystem.

Think of it this way:
Talus provides the infrastructure for building decentralized, revenue-generating AI agents.
Sentient provides the distribution layer, the network where those agents can be discovered, deployed, and scaled transparently.

This partnership bridges creation and adoption, giving developers not just the tools to build, but the platform to thrive.

Here’s why this matters:
1. Seamless Integration: Sentient’s model-agnostic architecture supports the OpenAI Chat Completions API, making it effortless for Talus developers to bring their agents on-chain and live within Sentient’s ecosystem.

2. Open Accessibility: With Talus Vision, anyone, even without technical expertise, can design agents through a no-code interface. Sentient then becomes the global showcase where those agents can interact with real users and generate real feedback.

3. Sustainable Incentives through GRID: Sentient’s Global Repository of Intelligence and Research Directory (GRID) ensures that open-source AI work gets rewarded fairly. Talus agents entering Sentient’s ecosystem will gain access to a community-driven economy that funds continued development based on usage, value, and conviction.

Together, this forms a self-reinforcing loop, a flywheel for the agentic economy:

=> Developers use Talus to create powerful, specialized agents
=> Users discover and interact with them on @SentientAGI
=> The ecosystem grows stronger through GRID-driven rewards and feedback

The result is an AI economy that’s open, verifiable, and community-owned, where every agent has both a purpose and a pathway to reach people.

This goes beyond only integration, it’s also about designing the infrastructure of intelligence:
A system where value, knowledge, and computation circulate transparently across open networks.

With Chainlink’s Runtime Environment (CRE), Sentient agents can pull in verified price feeds, macro data, and cross-chain states to coordinate and settle actions on their own. 

The Benefits?
This lets open AI models think with verifiable proofs, stick to constraints, and operate with built-in guardrails, marking a real step forward in building a transparent and trustworthy agentic world.

At its core, CRE serves as a complete orchestration layer for creating top tier smart contracts that connect easily to outside data, work across chains via CCIP, stay compliant and private, and link up with countless blockchains and financial systems.

Several leading platforms are already putting CRE to work in AI-driven setups. For instance, Coinbase’s x402 kicks things off as the first AI payments partner, letting agents handle payments independently through crypto wallets for secure onchain moves. Sentient itself builds open-source AI tools like ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat, tapping Chainlink’s data on prices, economics, and more, plus CRE for seamless integration, payments, and consensus to help AI make sharper calls with onchain evidence across Web3 and Web2.

CRE is a control center that lets AI agents work safely with blockchain and real world data, It helps build smart contracts that pull live data prices news, work on any blockchain, Follow rules and privacy and also pay or move money automatically.

They are just like an AI bot that trade, pay, and optimize, all by themselves securely.

@SentientAGI is positioned as one of the key partner Al lab among the 7 protocols specializing in developing powerful, open source Al systems like ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat.

Sentient leverages CRE's full capabilities to supercharge its Al agents in different categories like: 

1/. Data Access: It taps into Chainlink's real world data feeds, including asset prices and other off chain data, combined with on chain proofs for verifiable accuracy.

2/. Core CRE Features: This includes seamless cross chain Web3-Web2 coordination and payments via x402 for autonomous transactions which gives reliable decision making.

3/. Al Agent Enhancement: By integrating these, Sentient builds customized Al agents that make smarter decisions by bridging Al's intelligence with blockchain's security.

Sentient will be using chainlink’s CRE to make its open AI smarter and trustworthy, connecting AI to real blockchain data so agents don’t guess they know. 

This lets AI work safely across both Web3 and Web2 which is the normal internet, building a reliable AI environment that act on facts not just fiction.","53","","1","44","1","1488","Mon Nov 10 15:16:21 +0000 2025","en","1","false",,"1987902152115667032",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","591","603","Sentient","SentientAGI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/pfUS5EqKId","https://twitter.com/Mubii_0x/status/1987902152115667032/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987902143370584065","278","301","3_1987902143370584065","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuWcneP12ABCgACG5ZyeZkWwFgAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5Zyd4/XYAEKAAIblnJ5mRbAWAAA","3_1987902143370584065","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5Zyd4_XYAE456z.jpg","1075","1920","0","87","1280","1280","640","0","1280","1123","797","0","1280","640","1072","0","1280","1920","0","0","1280","1920","1280","1920","photo","https://t.co/pfUS5EqKId",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987154952863481886","Tweet","1468616839454466053","User","74820","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1858554741900414976/kRmwVjJ6_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1468616839454466053/1746466276","Wed Dec 08 16:22:17 +0000 2021","Mubarak4pf","Mubii_0x","false","false",,,,"","true",,"false","Researcher | Contributor | Writer",,"","1DA1F2","None","true","1556","1281","1468616839454466053","false","false","false","1980","41787","true",,"","EditControlInitial",,,,,,"1987154952863481886","1762613234000","5","true","false","0","1987154952863481886","Sat Nov 08 13:47:14 +0000 2025","0","281",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/07iEgEoWpm","https://twitter.com/Mubii_0x/status/1987154952863481886/photo/1",,"Available","1987154941102686208","282","305","3_1987154941102686208","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuTyuP6FoAACgACG5PK5rcWAB4AAA==","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5PK4_oWgAAi1dL.jpg","1280","1920","photo","https://t.co/07iEgEoWpm",,"52","Sentient recently collaborated with Talus, a blockchain based platform for building and running decentralized Ai agents for tasks like trading or managing assets on their own.

How 7 leading platforms are leveraging CRE for AI-powered workflows ↓                                                 

First, a quick primer on CRE:

CRE provides an all-in-one orchestration layer for building end-to-end institutional-grade smart contracts—smart contracts that are easily connected to external data, cross-chain enabled, compliance-ready, and privacy-preserving, which are able to securely interoperate across thousands of public and private blockchains, existing identity systems, and core financial infrastructure.

• x402 by @coinbase is now the first AI payments partner to enable agents to autonomously pay for CRE workflows. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) gives AI agents access to crypto wallets to perform onchain actions and make programmatic payouts via x402.

• @SentientAGI is a partner AI lab building powerful open-source AI systems, including ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat. Sentient can leverage all Chainlink's data – Asset Prices, Macroeconomic data, and other real-world data and CRE capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus, which are then integrated into customized powerful AI agents. This enables AI to make smarter decisions based on onchain proofs and coordinate intelligence across Web3 and Web2 environments.

• @gizatechxyz adopted CRE as the orchestration layer for reading onchain events and triggering agent logic focused on stablecoin yield optimization for USD1, dynamically deploying the stablecoin from World Liberty Financial across DeFi to maximize yield. This enables Giza’s yield optimization products, Arma and Pulse, to execute yield strategies across both stablecoins and other blue-chip DeFi assets.

• Chaos Chain (@Ch40sChain) is integrating CRE the Chainlink Runtime Environment to provide a set of pre-checks for any payment flow. Agentic pre-checks can significantly decrease the number of third-party API calls, reduce latency, and enable businesses to trust agents with real value, allowing them to discover, collaborate, and pay each other via the x402 standard.

• @codecopenflow is integrating the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) with its CodecFlow SDK (OPTR) to power MechaShip, a decentralized delivery network. CRE acts as the event-driven orchestration layer, automatically reacting to onchain DeliveryRequested events to discover available mechas (via ERC-8004), request quotes (via x402), and rank agents. OPTR enables the autonomous mechas to register, calculate dynamic pricing, and maintain real-time status via heartbeat monitoring.

• @ampli_inc is using the CRE for signing operations and powering its trusted execution environment to verify and authorize AI agent requests. The CRE enables agents to operate within guardrails and customizable policies that allow for compliant and secure operating environments.

How 7 leading platforms are leveraging CRE for AI-powered workflows ↓                                                 

First, a quick primer on CRE:

CRE provides an all-in-one orchestration layer for building end-to-end institutional-grade smart contracts—smart contracts that are easily connected to external data, cross-chain enabled, compliance-ready, and privacy-preserving, which are able to securely interoperate across thousands of public and private blockchains, existing identity systems, and core financial infrastructure.

• x402 by @coinbase is now the first AI payments partner to enable agents to autonomously pay for CRE workflows. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) gives AI agents access to crypto wallets to perform onchain actions and make programmatic payouts via x402.

• @SentientAGI is a partner AI lab building powerful open-source AI systems, including ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat. Sentient can leverage all Chainlink's data – Asset Prices, Macroeconomic data, and other real-world data and CRE capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus, which are then integrated into customized powerful AI agents. This enables AI to make smarter decisions based on onchain proofs and coordinate intelligence across Web3 and Web2 environments.

• @gizatechxyz adopted CRE as the orchestration layer for reading onchain events and triggering agent logic focused on stablecoin yield optimization for USD1, dynamically deploying the stablecoin from World Liberty Financial across DeFi to maximize yield. This enables Giza’s yield optimization products, Arma and Pulse, to execute yield strategies across both stablecoins and other blue-chip DeFi assets.

• Chaos Chain (@Ch40sChain) is integrating CRE the Chainlink Runtime Environment to provide a set of pre-checks for any payment flow. Agentic pre-checks can significantly decrease the number of third-party API calls, reduce latency, and enable businesses to trust agents with real value, allowing them to discover, collaborate, and pay each other via the x402 standard.

• @codecopenflow is integrating the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) with its CodecFlow SDK (OPTR) to power MechaShip, a decentralized delivery network. CRE acts as the event-driven orchestration layer, automatically reacting to onchain DeliveryRequested events to discover available mechas (via ERC-8004), request quotes (via x402), and rank agents. OPTR enables the autonomous mechas to register, calculate dynamic pricing, and maintain real-time status via heartbeat monitoring.

• @ampli_inc is using the CRE for signing operations and powering its trusted execution environment to verify and authorize AI agent requests. The CRE enables agents to operate within guardrails and customizable policies that allow for compliant and secure operating environments.

This is for sure a Bullish Catalyst for Agentic Future…
In a landmark announcement, Chainlink unveiled its Runtime Environment (CRE), a robust orchestration layer for secure, scalable AI-crypto workflows
 
highlighting @SentientAGI as a key partner among seven industry leaders. This integration marks a pivotal moment for Sentient, the open-source AI lab pioneering tools like ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat.

CRE equips Sentient's AI agents with Chainlink's battle-tested infrastructure: 
- Real-time asset prices
- Macroeconomic data
- Verifiable off-chain proofs

Agents now seamlessly blend Web3 interoperability, automated payments, and consensus mechanisms, enabling smarter, onchain-informed decisions.

This bridges Web2 intelligence with blockchain verifiability, allowing Sentient's systems to coordinate across ecosystems without trust silos.

For @SentientAGI, this is unequivocally bullish.
Chainlink's endorsement validates Sentient's vision, amplifying its edge in the $100B+ AI agent market. Enhanced security reduces risks, attracts institutional adoption, and unlocks revenue streams via x402 payments.

As agentic economies explode, projected to hit $50B by 2028, Sentient's fortified stack positions it for explosive growth, token value surge, and dominance in decentralized AI.

Just say I should explain this development to you, and I hope you got the alpha here

This is more than a partnership, it’s a bridge where open-source AGI is anchored on chain, strengthened by real world proofs, truly connecting artificial intelligence with blockchain
@SentientAGI @chainlink 

Why should we be this excited? 
Let me explain

Real World Proofs 
Sentient agents can now pull price feeds, macroeconomic data, and cross chain states from Chainlink oracles and verify everything directly on chain. They no longer ask “Is this data correct?” they act based on proof. Imagine an AI agent analyzing market fluctuations in seconds, executing a secure trade, and everything being completely transparent.

Autonomous Operations and Coordination
When combined with Sentient’s open-source models like ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat, agents truly operate independently. They verify data, make decisions, and execute payments, all within guardrails, safe and compliant No human in the loop!

Open and Verifiable Economy
This integration brings Sentient’s “Loyal AI” approach on chain. Instead of closed box AI, it creates an ecosystem everyone can access and audit. Programmable payments and credible routing for an agentic economy are all part of the system.

Web3 and Web2 are no longer separate; this bridge brings the future into the present.
As the Sentient community, we are at the center of this  all in for open AGI!

Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is the groundbreaking new architecture from Chainlink, officially launched on November 4, 2025. CRE is positioned as a universal orchestration layer for building enterprise-grade institutional smart contracts. It marks the evolution of Chainlink from simple oracles to a full-fledged decentralized computing environment that redefines the ""oracle problem"" at scale.

Key Features of CRE

- Modularity & DONs: Chainlink shifts to a model where each capability is powered by a dedicated Decentralized Oracle Network (DON):
Data Feeds (asset prices)
CCIP (cross-chain interoperability)
Proof of Reserve
Automated Compliance Engine (ACE) for regulatory compliance
Confidential Compute (private computations, launching 2026)

https://t.co/4UyHH9vp8N

- Workflow Orchestration: Developers write workflows in TypeScript or Go. Triggers include: 
Schedule-based
Event-driven
HTTP requests
CRE coordinates DON-to-DON communication and ensures Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus.

- Developer Tools: 
CLI for deployment, simulation, and testing
Web UI for monitoring and debugging
Local simulation with real APIs and testnets

https://t.co/EubWgQTqcN

- Institutional Use Cases (Already Live in Production):
@jpmorgan + @OndoFinance: Atomic cross-chain Delivery vs Payment (DvP)
@swiftcommunity + @EuroclearGroup: Corporate action processing
@UBS + @DigiFTTech: Redemption of tokenized funds
AWS/Google Cloud: Web2 integration

CRE is often compared to Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for the internet or COBOL for financial automation - a ""runtime environment"" that reduces development time 10–100x (from weeks to hours).

Role of Giza Protocol in CRE

@gizatechxyz is a platform for verifiable on-chain machine learning, enabling probabilistic ML models to run trustlessly on-chain. Giza is integrated into CRE as a core AI/ML workflow partner.

Specific Role:
Provides on-chain ML inference capability (predictions, scoring, risk models)
Used in CRE workflows for:
Risk-adjusted pricing of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs)
AI agents that trigger decentralized ML models

Giza enables running models like Llama or custom ones in a verifiable environment, while CRE orchestrates them alongside other capabilities (data feeds, compliance, cross-chain actions).

Without Giza, CRE would lack native AI depth. With Giza, it fully supports agentic AI - agents that think + act autonomously on-chain.

x402 by @Coinbase

x402 is an internet-native payment protocol launched by Coinbase in 2025. It revives HTTP status 402 ""Payment Required"" to enable instant micropayments in stablecoins (USDC on Base) directly within HTTP requests - no accounts, no API keys, no subscriptions.

How It Works:
1) Client (human or AI agent) requests a resource
2) Server responds with 402 + payment details (amount, token)
3) Client signs the payment and attaches it via header X-PAYMENT
4) Facilitator (Coinbase-hosted) verifies and settles on-chain

https://t.co/k3hKZVpnWT

Advantages:
Zero friction: no logins, no subscriptions
Perfect for AI agent-to-agent payments
Fee-free USDC transfers on Base
Backed by x402 Foundation (with @Cloudflare ) for open standardization

x402 + ERC-8004
ERC-8004 (""Trustless Agents"") - Ethereum Improvement Proposal finalized in August 2025. It standardizes identity, reputation, and discoverability of AI agents via an NFT registry (ERC-721 + URIStorage).

Synergy:
x402 = Value layer (payments)
ERC-8004 = Trust layer (identity & reputation)
Flow: Agent discovered via ERC-8004 → pays via x402 → leaves review with proof_of_payment → reputation updates

Now let's try to simulate how it will all work together:

- DeFi optimization (ARMA from Giza)
The autonomous agent Giza (ARMA type for yield on stablecoins) needs fresh data on prices or risks. It calls the CRE workflow from @LlamaRisk (Chainlink partner), pays x402, and receives risk-adjusted pricing for moving liquidity between protocols.

- Personalized DeFi risk management for 1,000+ wallets
The Giza agent manages the portfolios of 1,200 retail users (via a smart account bundler).
Every 15 minutes, it calls the CRE workflow from Gauntlet Network:
→ receives stress test scenarios for @aave , @MorphoLabs , and @pendle_fi.
→ pays x402 $0.08 for each wallet (a total of $96 every 15 minutes).
If the risk exceeds 8%, the agent automatically withdraws to USDC.

Stablecoin yield optimization with USD1 (World Liberty Financial)
A Giza agent (such as Arma or Pulse) monitors events on @worldlibertyfi. When the yield falls below 5%, it triggers a CRE workflow to read on-chain data (NAV, AUM from Chainlink oracles) and redistribute it to Aave/Morpho. The agent pays x402 $0.07 USDC per call, directly to the workflow creator. This allows USD1 to be dynamically deployed across DeFi without manual intervention, maximizing returns for users.

Final Picture
CRE = the brain (orchestration)
Giza = the AI muscles (verifiable ML)
x402 = the wallet (micropayments)
ERC-8004 = the passport (trust & identity)

Together, they form the foundation of the agentic economy - where AI agents autonomously collaborate, pay, and build reputation on-chain. @chainlink with CRE is becoming the central hub for both institutional finance and the AI-on-chain future.

解释一下这次合作对Sentient有什么帮助？

未来一些发展成熟的Agent，不是单纯聊天AI，而是可以查询数据、执行交易的那种做实事的AI。

但这些Agent无法直接碰到链上的钱和数据，所以就需要一个中间层，而这个中间层就是CRE(Chainlink Runtime Environment)。

如果一个Agent的任务是：帮我制定并执行一套defi收益策略，收益最大化的同时控制风险，那么整个流程如下：

1⃣收集信息

• 通过Chainlink预言机拉取链上资产价格、利率、流动性等数据

• 获取链下宏观经济数据判断当前的市场环境

• 查询热门defi协议（Lido、Aave、Curve等等）的当前收益率和风险水平。

此时Agent相当于一个分析师帮我们研究行情。

2⃣分析并制定策略

这一步通过一些方法生成几个策略可供选择。但不是这次合作的重点内容，就不展开了。

3⃣交给CRE执行

Agent想好方案后，具体的操作，比如调用合约、跨链、支付gas等等，这些都需要CRE安排和执行，并且CRE能确保操作安全。

还有一个很关键的点，因为Agent可以通过预言机获取链上实时数据，所以当链上数据发生变化，当前策略不再是最优解时，Agent会重新调用CRE撤掉旧的仓位，并生成新策略，调整到新的协议中去。

总之，这是一个可以自我执行并自我优化的循环。

Through the integration of Chainlink’s Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), Sentient’s agents can now operate using real-world proofs, access secure oracle data, and autonomously manage payments and coordination tasks across multiple chains.

This framework enables agents to “think with proofs” grounding their reasoning and decision-making in tamper-proof data sources rather than black-box inference.

For Sentient, which develops open frameworks like ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat, this partnership reinforces its goal of building trustworthy, open, and interoperable agent systems. 

By combining AI reasoning with blockchain guarantees, Sentient and Chainlink lay the foundation for a verifiable agentic economy, one where agents can act securely, respect constraints, and coordinate autonomously across digital and financial systems, advancing both AI reliability and Web3 scalability.","44","","1","42","1","511","Mon Nov 10 12:08:45 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1987854943319974326",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","26","38","Sentient","SentientAGI","1530530365","43","53","Chainlink","chainlink",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","pic.twitter.com/kVAudqs7tP","https://twitter.com/Tuchie18/status/1987854943319974326/photo/1","Available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987854933094256640","280","303","3_1987854933094256640","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuWR4eQF1AACgACG5ZHifGXYbYAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5ZHh5AXUAAKAAIblkeJ8ZdhtgAA","3_1987854933094256640","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5ZHh5AXUAAOQs0.png","347","620","0","28","389","389","231","0","389","341","279","0","389","195","382","0","389","620","0","0","389","620","389","620","photo","https://t.co/kVAudqs7tP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987292229971681595","Tweet","1314137887911411712","User","12443","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1912323745257082880/Q3f8Ww_R_normal.jpg","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1314137887911411712/1748948119","Thu Oct 08 09:38:15 +0000 2020","土江☂️","Tuchie18","true","false",,,,"","false","1867189391527121184","false","▪︎quid quaeris? ▪︎ aut viam inveniam aut faciam ▪︎ @ArciumHQ ▪︎",,"","1DA1F2","None","true","1023","1562","1314137887911411712","false","false","false","1395","21380","true",,"","EditControlInitial",,,,,,"1987292229971681595","1762645964000","5","true","false","0","1987292229971681595","Sat Nov 08 22:52:44 +0000 2025","0","280",,,,,,,,,"1912085033902616577","30","41","Talus Labs","Talus_Labs","1722248937564983296","59","67","0G Labs (Home of Infinite AI)","0G_labs","1754853230545133568","69","81","Sentient","SentientAGI","1529056786447323136","83","95","LAGRANGE","lagrangedev","1752421556494438401","100","114","Allora","AlloraNetwork",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"58","What’s Next for AI Agents” by @Talus_Labs brought together @0G_labs, @SentientAGI, @lagrangedev and @AlloraNetwork to discuss the future of decentralized AI.

Speakers outlined how emerging infrastructure: Sentient’s Grid + ROMA, 0G’s compute Layer 1, Allora’s predictive oracles, and Lagrange’s ZKP verification, is transforming AI agents from experimental bots into secure, autonomous systems.

Key takeaways: decentralized agents are evolving into a censorship-resistant coordination layer, supported by new standards like X4O2, ERC-8004, and ERC-7857. 
The panel forecast 2026 as the year open-source AI reaches parity with closed systems, driven by verifiability, composability, and yield generating autonomous agents that operate continuously without human input.

The discussion also emphasized the growing importance of trust, transparency, and economic alignment in decentralized AI ecosystems. With ZKPs ensuring verifiable computation, ROMA enabling recursive collaboration, and on-chain standards defining agent identity and privacy, the panelists described a maturing landscape where AI agents can safely transact, negotiate, and self-optimize across networks. 
This convergence of autonomy, accountability, and interoperability marks the shift from isolated AI models to networked, value-generating intelligence built for open, permissionless systems.

Not bots. Not placeholders.
Real, independent minds running on the GRID learning, testing, and evolving without a single company pulling the strings.

That’s not “future someday.”
That’s right now.

Every new agent makes the network smarter.
Every new contributor makes the system harder to own, censor, or shut down.

This isn’t a startup milestone.
It’s the first proof that open AGI can scale and it’s happening in public.

First, a quick primer on CRE:

CRE provides an all-in-one orchestration layer for building end-to-end institutional-grade smart contracts—smart contracts that are easily connected to external data, cross-chain enabled, compliance-ready, and privacy-preserving, which are able to securely interoperate across thousands of public and private blockchains, existing identity systems, and core financial infrastructure.

• x402 by @coinbase is now the first AI payments partner to enable agents to autonomously pay for CRE workflows. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) gives AI agents access to crypto wallets to perform onchain actions and make programmatic payouts via x402.

• @SentientAGI is a partner AI lab building powerful open-source AI systems, including ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat. Sentient can leverage all Chainlink's data – Asset Prices, Macroeconomic data, and other real-world data and CRE capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus, which are then integrated into customized powerful AI agents. This enables AI to make smarter decisions based on onchain proofs and coordinate intelligence across Web3 and Web2 environments.

• @gizatechxyz adopted CRE as the orchestration layer for reading onchain events and triggering agent logic focused on stablecoin yield optimization for USD1, dynamically deploying the stablecoin from World Liberty Financial across DeFi to maximize yield. This enables Giza’s yield optimization products, Arma and Pulse, to execute yield strategies across both stablecoins and other blue-chip DeFi assets.

• Chaos Chain (@Ch40sChain) is integrating CRE the Chainlink Runtime Environment to provide a set of pre-checks for any payment flow. Agentic pre-checks can significantly decrease the number of third-party API calls, reduce latency, and enable businesses to trust agents with real value, allowing them to discover, collaborate, and pay each other via the x402 standard.

• @codecopenflow is integrating the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) with its CodecFlow SDK (OPTR) to power MechaShip, a decentralized delivery network. CRE acts as the event-driven orchestration layer, automatically reacting to onchain DeliveryRequested events to discover available mechas (via ERC-8004), request quotes (via x402), and rank agents. OPTR enables the autonomous mechas to register, calculate dynamic pricing, and maintain real-time status via heartbeat monitoring.

• @ampli_inc is using the CRE for signing operations and powering its trusted execution environment to verify and authorize AI agent requests. The CRE enables agents to operate within guardrails and customizable policies that allow for compliant and secure operating environments.

• ElizaOS leverages the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) via its Spartan agent to power AI-driven execution. This enables the agent to autonomously manage liquidity, execute cross-chain arbitrage, and monitor protocol risk using real-time, on-chain data.

While everyone's talking about AI agents, @SentientAGI is building the decentralized backbone that makes them actually work at scale.

CRE brings:
> Oracles connecting LLMs to real world data
> Cross chain interoperability for AI models
> Privacy preserving computation via TEEs

This isn't just another AI project, it's infrastructure that lets AGI systems like Sentient Chat operate trustlessly across chains. Think OML (Open Model Library) meets smart contracts.

The genius? Dobby agents can now verify data, execute on chain actions, and maintain privacy, all while staying open source. No centralized chokepoints.

Roma integration on Polygon means these AI models can scale without sacrificing decentralization. That's the missing piece everyone's been looking for.

• @gizatechxyz adopted CRE as the orchestration layer for reading onchain events and triggering agent logic focused on stablecoin yield optimization for USD1, dynamically deploying the stablecoin from World Liberty Financial across DeFi to maximize yield. This enables Giza’s yield optimization products, Arma and Pulse, to execute yield strategies across both stablecoins and other blue-chip DeFi assets.

• Chaos Chain (@Ch40sChain) is integrating CRE the Chainlink Runtime Environment to provide a set of pre-checks for any payment flow. Agentic pre-checks can significantly decrease the number of third-party API calls, reduce latency, and enable businesses to trust agents with real value, allowing them to discover, collaborate, and pay each other via the x402 standard.

• @codecopenflow is integrating the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) with its CodecFlow SDK (OPTR) to power MechaShip, a decentralized delivery network. CRE acts as the event-driven orchestration layer, automatically reacting to onchain DeliveryRequested events to discover available mechas (via ERC-8004), request quotes (via x402), and rank agents. OPTR enables the autonomous mechas to register, calculate dynamic pricing, and maintain real-time status via heartbeat monitoring.

• @ampli_inc is using the CRE for signing operations and powering its trusted execution environment to verify and authorize AI agent requests. The CRE enables agents to operate within guardrails and customizable policies that allow for compliant and secure operating environments.

• ElizaOS leverages the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) via its Spartan agent to power AI-driven execution. This enables the agent to autonomously manage liquidity, execute cross-chain arbitrage, and monitor protocol risk using real-time, on-chain data.

How 7 leading platforms are leveraging CRE for AI-powered workflows ↓                                                 

First, a quick primer on CRE:

CRE provides an all-in-one orchestration layer for building end-to-end institutional-grade smart contracts—smart contracts that are easily connected to external data, cross-chain enabled, compliance-ready, and privacy-preserving, which are able to securely interoperate across thousands of public and private blockchains, existing identity systems, and core financial infrastructure.

• x402 by @coinbase is now the first AI payments partner to enable agents to autonomously pay for CRE workflows. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) gives AI agents access to crypto wallets to perform onchain actions and make programmatic payouts via x402.

• @SentientAGI is a partner AI lab building powerful open-source AI systems, including ROMA, OpenDeepSearch, and Sentient Chat. Sentient can leverage all Chainlink's data – Asset Prices, Macroeconomic data, and other real-world data and CRE capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus, which are then integrated into customized powerful AI agents. This enables AI to make smarter decisions based on onchain proofs and coordinate intelligence across Web3 and Web2 environments.

這是AI 智能體開始「真正連上現實世界」的關鍵一步
以前的 AI 再聰明，也只是「紙上談兵」
它能回答問題、生成內容
但沒辦法確定什麼是真的，什麼是假的

這次有了 Chainlink CRE（Runtime Environment）
Sentient 的智能體就像多了一雙能「觸碰真實」的手
CRE 會幫它接入真實世界的資料

經過驗證的幣價

宏觀經濟數據

各鏈之間的狀態變化

這些都是真實可證明的資訊
讓 AI 不再是憑感覺，而是「用證據思考」

可以想像成以前的 AI 是個閉門造車的天才
聰明，但跟現實脫節
現在 Chainlink 幫它開了一扇窗
它可以直接看到外面的世界

比如一個 DeFi 智能體
它不只是知道市場在波動
還能根據鏈上真實價格自己決定什麼時候調整策略
甚至完成結算

更酷的是CRE 不只是提供資料，它還幫 Sentient 的 AI守規矩
AI 行動時會有一套安全護欄
要符合合約規範、要合法合規、要在安全區間內動作
這就像是讓 AI 有了腦子也有了紀律
既能自由思考，又不會亂來

這合作代表一個超大的趨勢
AI 不只是生成文字或圖片的工具
而是能真正「動起來」的代理（agent）
Sentient 提供了智能體大腦
Chainlink 負責接上現實世界的神經與感官
兩邊一結合，就是下一代「能自己思考、能自己行動」的開放式 AI 生態

it needs 3 things 
real world proofs
programmable payments
credible routing

that’s where @SentientAGI plugging into chainlink cre actually matters

with chainlink runtime environment
sentient agents can read verified price feeds, macro data and cross chain state

then coordinate, execute and settle autonomously on the same rails used by serious onchain finance

no guessing, no scraped junk, no fake fills
agents act on authenticated data with programmable payouts and constraints baked in
open models on sentient
secured by chainlink infra
means decisions you can audit, moves you can verify, flows you can trust

this is a real step toward an open, verifiable agentic economy
ai that plugs into them correctly

making sure autonomous intelligence doesn’t free ride on vibes

The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CER) is honestly one of the most exciting pieces of infrastructure emerging right now. It’s basically becoming the arrangement engine for secure, scalable, agentic workflows, the missing layer that lets crypto and AI actually work together in the real world.

I’ve been diving into how different platforms are using CER. It gives you an all-in-one orchestration layer to build end-to-end, institutional-grade smart contracts that can connect to real-world data, work across chains, remain compliance-ready, preserve privacy, and interoperate with thousands of public/private blockchains and legacy financial systems which everything developers have needed for years.

With Chainlink, Sentient’s agents can tap into verified onchain data like asset prices, macroeconomic feeds, and other real-world signals. They also gain CER capabilities like interop, payments, and consensus.

That means Sentient can build AI agents that are not just “intelligent,” but grounded in cryptographic truth agents that can coordinate across Web3 + Web2, execute workflows, settle payments, and make decisions based on real, tamper-proof data.

It’s one of the biggest partnerships I’m watching in the AI × crypto space right now.","47","","1","26","1","532","Mon Nov 10 05:39:36 +0000 2025","en","0","false",,"1987757007705911671",,,"false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1754853230545133568","15","27","Sentient","SentientAGI","1530530365","32","42","Chainlink","chainlink",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pic.twitter.com/cTcy4okgLo","https://twitter.com/nandhanxt/status/1987757007705911671/photo/1","Available","Sentient Foundation","sentient_found","user","1885499970373246977","Abhishek Saxena","abhishek095","user","100950545","Sandeep | CEO, Polygon Foundation (※,※)","sandeepnailwal","user","100798845","Vivek Kolli","vivekkolli","user","1872674130535018496","RANA","LeaderX_btc","user","1657032675339784197","Chainlink","chainlink","user","1530530365",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1987757000382701568","279","302","3_1987757000382701568","QXBpTWVkaWFSZXN1bHRzOgwAAQoAARuV7nXTm2AACgACG5Xud4gasXcAAA==","ApiMedia","QXBpTWVkaWE6DAABCgABG5XuddObYAAKAAIble53iBqxdwAA","3_1987757000382701568","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5XuddObYAAnp5J.jpg","564","1008","0","146","935","935","73","0","935","820","188","0","935","468","540","0","935","1008","0","0","935","1008","935","1008","photo","https://t.co/cTcy4okgLo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",
